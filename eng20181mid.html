                Perhaps love is like a resting place <br>
                A shelter from the storm<br>
                It exists to give you comfort<br>
                It is there to keep you warm<br>
                And in those times of trouble<br>
                When you are most alone<br>
                The memory of love will bring you home<br>

                Perhaps love is like a window<br>
                Perhaps an open door<br>
                It invites you to come closer<br>
                It wants to show you more<br>
                And even if you lose yourself<br>
                And don't know what to do<br>
                The memory of love will see you through<br>

                For some a way to feel<br>
                And some say love is holding on<br>
                And some say letting go<br>
                And some say love is everything<br>

          My name is Mohamed Rahman. I live in Bangladesh. <u><strong>ⓐIt</strong></u> rains a lot in my country.
          <u>㉠Last year, I could not go to school for weeks because we had floods.</u>
          This year, we had floods again. Father said, “The floods are becoming worse.
          <u>㉡The ice in the Himalayas is melting more these days</u>, and <u><strong>ⓑit</strong></u> rains more often.”  <br>
           I was very worried. I said, "I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
           <u>㉢If I miss so much school again, how can I become a teacher?"</u> <br>
           However, things were different this year. <u><strong>ⓒIt</strong></u> was the first day of school today,
           and the school was coming to me! <u><strong>ⓓIt</strong></u> was a school boat! <u><strong>ⓔIt</strong></u>  was going to come from
           Monday to Saturday and stay at the village for three hours. <br>
           My little sister and I were ready for school very early in the morning.
           <u>㉣We went outside and waited with the other children.</u> When the boat finally came, we all got excited. <br>
           <u>㉤On the school boat, there were 40 seats for older children in the front and benches
           for little children at the back.</u> There were even computers and a library. <br>
           My friends and I learned math and science. We learned to use the Internet, too.

  <p>       Yesterday, I saw a documentary on TV. It was about a man ㉠that tried to live without doing any harm to the environment. After watching ⓐit, I decided to start my own project, “Project Green Kid.” < A >
  </p>
    <p>May 19 No More Elevators! <br>
    Today was my first day as a Green Kid. I started my first project day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator. < B > I felt great because ⓑmy small effort saved electricity. ⓒThe only problem is ㉡that my apartment is on the 15th floor. I guess I'd better not go out too often.
  </p>
    <p>May 22 No More Leftover Food! <br>
    Today, I finished everything on my lunch plate. Was the food great today? Not really. I did ㉢that because leftover food pollutes the environment. < C > However, there was ⓓone little problem. I was sleepy all afternoon. I'd better put less food on my plate tomorrow.
  </p>
    <p>May 25 A Great Idea for Saving Water <br>
    There are so many people ㉣that do not have enough water all over the world. What can I do to save water? I thought hard and got ⓔa great idea. I decided to take a shower every other day, not every day. Today, I proudly went to school without taking a shower. Did I smell a little? Well, I don’t care!! < D >
  </p>
    <p>May 28 Saving Trees at the Picnic <br>
    Today, my family went on a picnic. Our picnic box was heavier than usual because we didn’t bring paper cups or plates. < E >
   The picnic was great, but I had to do the dishes when we came home. I don’t enjoy doing the dishes, but I can stand ㉤that much to help the environment!
