  [객6-7] 'Perhaps Love' 노래 가사를 읽고 다음 물음에 답하시오. 
 <div class="jimun">
   Perhaps love is like a resting place <br>
   A shelter from the storm<br>
   <u>①It exists to give you comfort</u><br>
   <u>②It is there to keep you warm</u><br>
   <br>
   And in those times of trouble<br>
   When you are most alone<br>
   The memory of love will bring you home<br>
   <br>
   Perhaps love is like a window<br>
   Perhaps an open door<br>
   <u>③It invites you to come closer</u><br>
   <u>④It wants to show you more</u><br>
   <br>
   And even if you lose yourself<br>
   And don't know what to do<br>
   The memory of love will see you through<br>
   <br>
   Oh love to some is like a cloud<br>
   To some as strong as steel<br>
   For some a way of living<br>
   For some a way to feel<br>
   <br>
   And some say love is holding on<br>
   And some say letting go<br>
   And some say love is everything<br>
   Some say they don't know<br>
   <br>
   Perhaps love is like the ocean<br>
   Full of conflict, full of pain<br>
   Like a fire when it's cold outside<br>
   <u>⑤Thunder when it rains</u><br>
   <br>
   If I should live forever<br>
   And all my dreams come true<br>
   My memories of love will be of you<br>
