     There are so many people <u>ⓐwhich</u> do not have enough water all over the world.
    <strong>< A ></strong> I thought hard and got a great idea. I decided <u>ⓑtake</u> a shower every other day, not every day.
     <strong>< B ></strong> Today, I proudly went to school without taking a shower.
     Did I smell a little? Well, I don’t care!!</p> <br>

     <strong>< C ></strong> Today, my family went on a picnic. Our picnic box was <u>ⓒheavy</u> than usual because
     we didn’t bring paper cups and plates. </p>
   <p>  Mom said, “_________<u>(가)</u>_______ .”  <br>
     <strong>< D ></strong> The picnic was great, but I had to <u>ⓓdo</u> the dishes when we came home.
     <strong>< E ></strong> I don’t enjoy <u>ⓔdoing</u> the dishes, but I can do that to help the environment!  </p>
