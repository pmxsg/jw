  <p>  My name is Mohamed Rahman. I live in Bangladesh. It rains a lot in my country.
   Last year, I could not go to school for weeks because we had floods.
   This year, we had floods again. Father said, “The floods are becoming worse.
   The ice in the Himalayas is melting more these days, and it rains more often.” </p>
   <p> I was very worried. I said, "I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
    If I miss so much school again, how can I become a teacher?" <strong>< A ></strong> </p>
   <p> However, things were different this year. It was the first day of school today,
     and the school was coming to me! It was a school boat! It was going to come from Monday
     to Saturday and stay at the village for three hours. <strong>< B ></strong></p>
   <p> My little sister and I were ready for school very early in the morning.
     We went outside and waited with the other children. When the boat finally came, we all got excited. <strong> < C ></strong> </p>
   <p> On the school boat, there were 40 seats for older children in the front and benches for
     little children at the back. There were even computers and a library. <strong>< D ></strong> </p>
   <p> My friends and I learned math and science. We learned to use the Internet, too.
     We had so much fun. <strong>< E ></strong> </p>
    <p>I love my school boat. I’m very happy because I can go to school and study now.
      When I become a teacher in the future, I want to teach children like me on a school boat.</p>
